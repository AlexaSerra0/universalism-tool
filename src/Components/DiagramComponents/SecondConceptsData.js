Norms, values, and beliefs create and shape customs, which in turn affects behavior in the form of actions and events. In software systems, customs are established user behaviors and practices that develop over time.",
  requirement: 'ShareTheMeal app users regularly sharing their meal donations on social media through the ShareTheMeal app could become a custom that promotes the app’s goal and increases its visibility. Subscribing to a monthly donation could also become a custom that aligns with the app’s goals of providing consistent support for reducing global hunger.',

  concept: 'Social Environment',
  description: 'Social environment refers to the immediate physical and social setting in which people live or in which something happens or develops. It includes the culture that the individual was educated or lives in, and the people and institutions with whom they interact. In software systems, social environment is the digital context where users interact with the platform.',

  description: 'Social Interaction defines an interaction between individuals. It is a specialization of an action. Social interaction can influence individuals and their beliefs. In software systems, social interaction refers to how users engage with each other using digital platforms. This can be done through activities like messaging, sharing content, and participating in discussions.',

  concept: 'Security',
  description: 'Security is considered the measures taken in order to prevent, minimize and correctly address threats towards valuable assets.  It corresponds to the level of defense that an asset possesses against malicious attackers. In software systems, it implies the implementation of protocols and technologies to protect data, ensure privacy, and maintain system integrity against cyber threats and unauthorized access.',
  requirement: "ShareTheMeal app has an infrastructure based on security standards. To ensure that the payment information is safe and secure, everything is processed by Braintree/Paypal.

It specifies the necessary security protocols that must be implemented to protect the system from threats.",

  description: "A Security Mechanism, also known as a countermeasure, is an architectural mechanism, that is, strategic decision, that addresses security requirements and/or minimizes vulnerabilities. These mechanisms can be hardware, software, manual procedures, or training, designed to improve security. Examples include user IDs, passwords, encryption, firewalls, and antivirus software.",
  requirement: "ShareTheMeal app uses HTTPS to secure a channel from the app to the server. The payment information is secure because it’s processed by Braintree, a globally trusted PayPal payments company. Every communication is point-to-point encrypted, SHA-256 with RSA encryption.",
